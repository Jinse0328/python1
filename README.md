Package Summary:
This is a code which show how to use nltk package to analyze sentiment of a text by Python.

Install and Run Instructions:
Install those three to run it
1. pip3 install nltk
2. python3 -m nltk.downloader

Code:
This code is for checking positve, negative, and neatural sentiment of each texts. By SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, it is able to get score of each texts and sort them to positive, negative, and neatural.

Future Idea:
By this code, it will be able to delete negative commnents automatically and move positive comments to the top side in social media or online communities. The reason that I figured out this idea is there are many malicious comments online these days and the issue can cause severe problems. So, to prevent the problems, this code might be useful.
